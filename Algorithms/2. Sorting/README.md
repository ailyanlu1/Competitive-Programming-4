## Sorting algorithms

In the field of computer science, sorting algorithms are algorithms that help puts elements in a list in a certain order. The most used orders are either numerical or lexicographical order. Effecient sorting is important for optimizing the system that is trying to sort data i.e. reduce number of I/O on computer memory fasten ups the system.
